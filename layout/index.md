Welcome to my website.

I'm currently a Fire Sprinkler Surveyor by day, and a CS graduate student by night.

I am slated to graduate this fall with an MS in Computer Science (Machine Learning Concentration) at George Mason University.

In my free time, I like to work on my side projects.

I mostly like to write in `python` but I am also familiar with `c`, `c++`, `java`, and `JavaScript`.

I think functional programming is really cool so I have some experience in `haskell` and `lisp`.

My favorite `python` package is `beautifulsoup4` since I like to build web scrapers, as you will see below.

I also like creating web applications with `Flask` and `django` too.

## Projects

[**ladio**](https://github.com/shinjustin/ladio)
is a K-Pop music chart aggregator that combines the top 100 songs of major K-Pop music charts.
The scrapers are written in `python` and uses `beautifulsoup4` for the scraping and `fuzzywuzzy` for the song title matching.

[**daum-tv-api**](https://github.com/shinjustin/daum-tv-api)
is an unofficial [daum.net](https://www.daum.net) API for Korean TV show metadata.
It can be used to pull interesting data like song titles of music that played during an episode or its Nielson ratings.
It was written in `python` and uses `beautifulsoup4`.

[**islewdmovie**](https://github.com/shinjustin/islewdmovie)
is an unoffical [IMDb](https://imdb.com) API for the crowd-sourced parental guide found buried in the website.
I use this to help avoid watching lewd or overly violent films with my family.
It was written in `python` and uses `beautifulsoup4`.
It also includes a web interface built with `Flask` and `Bootstrap5`.

[**dotcom**](https://github.com/shinjustin/dotcom)
serves as both the repository for my `markdown` source files, as well as the static site generator, for this website.
It was written in `python` and uses `jinja2` to convert the `markdown` into `html` using custom templates.
If you find a typo on this site, let me know by sending a pull request or by [email](mailto:aloha@shinjustin.com).
